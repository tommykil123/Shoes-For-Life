# Shoes-For-Life
UofM EECS504: Foundations of Computer Vision Fall 2020
The purpose of this project is to perform an overlay of a picture of a retailer shoes (Nike, Adidas, etc) over an image of the shoes of the user (customer). This project was inspired as a result of COVID-19 as many retailers are forced to shut down with the stay-in-home mandates. We hope this project will help consumers shop with confidence and as a allow the clothing industry to thrive despite being hit hard by the pandemic.  

There were several steps that we took to accomplish this which will be outlined in this repository.
